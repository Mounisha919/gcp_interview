## üìå GCP Resource Hierarchy (Short & Impressive)

* GCP‚Äôs resource hierarchy starts at the **Organization** level, followed by optional **Folders**, then **Projects**, and finally **Resources**.
* **Organization** manages IAM, policies, and billing centrally.
* **Folders** group projects logically (e.g., dev, prod, teams).
* **Projects** are the unit where all resources are created and managed.
* **Resources** (VMs, storage, etc.) live within projects and inherit IAM policies.
* Policies and permissions flow **top-down**, making governance scalable and secure.

---

## üì¶ GCP Project, Project ID, and Number

* **Project**: Core container for GCP resources, APIs, IAM, billing.
* **Project Name**: User-friendly label (editable).
* **Project ID**: Permanent, globally unique identifier (used in APIs, CLI).
* **Project Number**: System-generated numeric ID (used internally).

> Example:
> `Project Name: Analytics System`
> `Project ID: analytics-prod-123`
> `Project Number: 998877665544`

## üîÑ Storage Lifecycle Management

### ‚úÖ Benefits

* **Cost Optimization**: Move older data to cheaper storage.
* **Automation**: Reduce manual effort in managing data.
* **Compliance**: Meet retention policies via auto-deletion.

### üìò How It Works

Lifecycle rules consist of **conditions** and **actions**.

#### üî∏ Conditions:

* Age of object
* Last access time
* Object version
* Custom metadata

#### üî∏ Actions:

* `SetStorageClass`: Change to a lower-cost tier.
* `Delete`: Permanently delete the object.

---

## üõ† Example Rules

### 1. Transition to Coldline after 30 days:

```json
{
  "rule": [
    {
      "action": { "type": "SetStorageClass", "storageClass": "COLDLINE" },
      "condition": { "age": 30 }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Delete objects after 365 days:

```json
{
  "rule": [
    {
      "action": { "type": "Delete" },
      "condition": { "age": 365 }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Delete non-live versions older than 30 days:

```json
{
  "rule": [
    {
      "action": { "type": "Delete" },
      "condition": { "age": 30, "isLive": false }
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## üí° Real-Time Lifecycle Example

**Backup Data Workflow**:

1. New backup ‚Üí Standard Storage
2. After 30 days ‚Üí Nearline
3. After 6 months ‚Üí Coldline
4. After 7 years ‚Üí Deleted

This pattern minimizes cost while preserving necessary retention.

---

## üßØ Data Deletion & Recovery

### ‚ùå No Trash Bin

GCS does **not** have a "trash bin." Once deleted, data is gone unless:

### üîÑ Object Versioning

* Previous versions of deleted/overwritten objects are retained.
* Enable with:

```bash
gsutil versioning set on gs://your-bucket-name
```

### üîê Retention Policy

* Prevents deletion of objects before a specified time.
* Enforces legal and compliance data retention.

### üîÅ Backup & DR Tools

* Use tools like Cloud Backup and DR for external recovery options.

---

## üó£ Interview-Ready Summary

"Google Cloud Storage Lifecycle Management allows automated object transitions and deletions based on rules like object age or access time. This helps reduce costs by moving data to lower-cost storage classes and ensures compliance by enforcing retention policies. For example, backup files can move from Standard to Coldline after 30 days and be deleted after 7 years‚Äîall automatically."

# Google Cloud Storage (GCS) - Key Concepts

This document outlines essential Google Cloud Storage features like Backup handling, Signed URLs, and Static Website Hosting.

---

## üìÅ 1. File Deletion and Backup in GCS

- **Permanent Deletion**: By default, deleting a file from a GCS bucket is irreversible ‚Äî GCS has no recycle bin.
- **Backup Options**:
  - **Object Versioning**: When enabled, older versions of deleted files are retained.
    ```bash
    gsutil versioning set on gs://your-bucket-name
    ```
  - **Manual or Automated Backups**: Files may be stored in a separate backup location (different bucket or region) by scheduled jobs or backup tools.
  - **Retention Policies**: Prevents deletion of files for a specified time period to comply with data governance.

---

## üîê 2. Signed URLs

### What is a Signed URL?
A **Signed URL** is a secure, time-limited link that allows access to a GCS object without requiring direct authentication.

### Key Features:
- **Temporary access** to private files.
- Supports **read, write, and delete** permissions.
- Signed using a **cryptographic key** and expires after a defined period.

### Example (Python):
```python
from google.cloud import storage
from datetime import timedelta

client = storage.Client()
bucket = client.bucket('your-bucket-name')
blob = bucket.blob('your-object-name')

url = blob.generate_signed_url(
    expiration=timedelta(hours=1),
    method='GET'
)

print("Signed URL:", url)
Here‚Äôs a complete `README.md` that combines the interview-style explanations of **GCS Signed URLs**, **Static Web Hosting**, **VPC**, **VPC Types**, and **VPC Peering** into a well-structured and professional document:

# Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Concepts ‚Äì Interview Preparation Guide

This document provides concise, interview-ready explanations of key Google Cloud Platform (GCP) networking and storage features, including VPCs, static web hosting, signed URLs, and VPC peering.

---

## üì¶ 1. Signed URL in GCP

A **Signed URL** provides **temporary, secure access** to private objects in a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket. It allows access without needing to authenticate with GCP directly.

### üîë Key Points:
- **Time-limited Access**: The URL expires after a defined time.
- **Permission Scoped**: Can be scoped to specific actions (e.g., `GET`, `PUT`).
- **Cryptographically Signed**: Ensures authenticity.

### üõ† Use Case:
- Securely share files with external users without exposing the bucket publicly.

### üìå Example:
Generate a signed URL to download a file valid for 1 hour.

```python
from google.cloud import storage
from datetime import timedelta

client = storage.Client()
bucket = client.bucket('your-bucket-name')
blob = bucket.blob('your-object-name')

url = blob.generate_signed_url(expiration=timedelta(hours=1), method='GET')
print("Signed URL:", url)
````

---

## üåê 2. Static Web Hosting on GCS

**Static Web Hosting** serves static files (HTML, CSS, JS, images) via HTTP/HTTPS directly from a GCS bucket.

### üîß Steps:

1. Upload website files to a GCS bucket.
2. Configure the bucket for **public access**.
3. Set the default `index.html` and optionally a `404.html`.

### ‚úÖ Benefits:

* **Scalable and Fast** (CDN-backed).
* **Low Cost**.
* **Secure** (no server-side code to exploit).

### üìå Use Case:

Hosting personal portfolios, documentation, landing pages.

---

## üîó 3. Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in GCP

A **VPC** is a virtual network in GCP that allows you to define networking for your cloud resources, including IP ranges, routes, subnets, and firewalls.

### üß© Features:

* **Global Scope**: One VPC spans all regions.
* **Subnets**: Region-specific IP ranges.
* **Firewall Rules**: Control traffic to/from resources.
* **Private/Public IPs**: Used for internal/external access.
* **Cloud NAT**: Enables outbound internet for private resources.
* **Shared VPC**: Share VPCs across multiple projects.

### üìå Use Case:

Secure communication between cloud resources, isolation of environments (dev/stage/prod), and connecting on-prem via VPN.

---

## üõ£ 4. Types of VPC in GCP

### üü¢ Auto Mode VPC

* Subnets created automatically for all regions.
* Predefined IP ranges (`/20`).
* Ideal for small, quick-start projects.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Custom Mode VPC

* Subnets are **manually created**.
* Full control over IP ranges and regions.
* Best for **enterprise-level** or complex network setups.

---

## üîÑ 5. VPC Network Peering

**VPC Peering** enables private, internal IP-based communication between two VPC networks.

### üîê Key Features:

* **Private Connectivity** (no public internet involved).
* **Global or Regional Peering**.
* **Non-transitive** (A-B and B-C doesn‚Äôt imply A-C).
* **No Overlapping CIDRs** allowed.

### üß™ Setup Steps:

1. Create two VPCs.
2. Set up peering in both directions:

   ```bash
   gcloud compute networks peerings create peering-a-to-b \
     --network=vpc-a \
     --peer-network=vpc-b \
     --auto-create-routes

   gcloud compute networks peerings create peering-b-to-a \
     --network=vpc-b \
     --peer-network=vpc-a \
     --auto-create-routes
   ```
3. Update firewall rules to allow traffic.

### üìå Use Cases:

* Communication across VPCs in different projects.
* Secure resource sharing between isolated environments.
* Hybrid connectivity with on-premises data centers.

Let me know if you'd like this as a downloadable file or need more topics added like Cloud NAT, Cloud Interconnect, or Load Balancers.
```
Here's a well-structured `README.md` that summarizes NAT Gateways and Load Balancers in **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** for documentation or learning purposes:

---

# GCP Networking: NAT Gateways and Load Balancers

This document provides an overview of **NAT Gateways** and **Load Balancers** in Google Cloud Platform (GCP), covering their purpose, types, use cases, and implementation examples.

---

## üåê NAT Gateway in GCP

### What is a NAT Gateway?

A **Network Address Translation (NAT) Gateway** allows instances in a **private subnet** to access the internet **without exposing** those instances to incoming external traffic.

### üîë Key Concepts

* **Private IPs**: Internal addresses not routable from the internet.
* **Public IPs**: External addresses used for internet communication.

### üéØ Purpose of NAT

* Allows **outbound** internet access for private resources.
* Blocks **inbound** traffic from the internet to private instances.

### üîß How It Works

* **Outbound Requests**: Routed via NAT; private IP is translated to a public IP.
* **Inbound Responses**: Allowed only for existing outbound connections.

### üõ†Ô∏è Types of NAT in GCP

#### 1. **Cloud NAT (Managed)**

* Fully managed NAT service.
* Auto-scaled and integrated with VPC.
* No need to manage infrastructure.

```bash
# Example setup using gcloud CLI
gcloud compute routers create cloud-router --network my-network --region us-central1

gcloud compute routers nats create my-nat --router=cloud-router --region us-central1 \
    --nat-all-subnet-ip-ranges --auto-allocate-nat-external-ips
```

#### 2. **Self-Managed NAT**

* Deploy a VM in a public subnet.
* Manually configure forwarding rules and firewall rules.
* Greater control but higher maintenance.

---

## üß≠ Load Balancers in GCP

### What is a Load Balancer?

A **Load Balancer** distributes incoming traffic across multiple backend instances to ensure availability, fault tolerance, and performance.

---

### üîç Types of Load Balancers in GCP

| Load Balancer Type             | Layer | Scope    | Protocols    | Use Case                      |
| ------------------------------ | ----- | -------- | ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| HTTP(S) Load Balancer          | 7     | Global   | HTTP, HTTPS  | Web apps, content routing     |
| SSL Proxy Load Balancer        | 7     | Global   | HTTPS, SSL   | Encrypted traffic offloading  |
| TCP/UDP Network Load Balancer  | 4     | Regional | TCP, UDP     | Non-HTTP apps like DBs        |
| Internal HTTP(S) Load Balancer | 7     | Regional | HTTP, HTTPS  | Microservices inside VPC      |
| Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancer | 4     | Regional | TCP, UDP     | Internal legacy or DB traffic |
| Global Load Balancer           | 7     | Global   | HTTP(S), SSL | Multi-region failover         |

---

### üí° Example Use Cases

* **HTTP(S) Load Balancer**: Public-facing websites with URL-based routing.
* **Internal HTTP(S)**: Microservices talking within a private VPC.
* **SSL Proxy LB**: Terminate SSL and forward decrypted traffic.
* **TCP/UDP LB**: Load balance MySQL traffic or game servers.
* **Global LB**: Serve global users with the lowest latency.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

* Use **Cloud NAT** to securely enable outbound internet access for private instances.
* Choose the **right load balancer** based on:

  * Traffic type (HTTP vs TCP)
  * Scope (Internal vs External)
  * Protocol (Layer 4 vs Layer 7)
  * Region (Regional vs Global)

# GCP IAM, IAP, and Cloud Run Explained

This document provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of three key Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services: IAM (Identity and Access Management), IAP (Identity-Aware Proxy), and Cloud Run.

---

## üìå GCP IAM (Identity and Access Management)

IAM helps administrators securely manage who (identity) has what access (role) to which resources. It enforces the principle of **least privilege**, ensuring users/services only have access they truly need.

### üîê Key Concepts

#### Identity

* **Google Accounts** (e.g., `user@gmail.com`)
* **Service Accounts**: For apps or VMs
* **Google Groups**
* **Cloud Identity/G Suite Users**

#### Roles

* **Primitive Roles**:

  * `Owner`: Full control
  * `Editor`: Modify resources
  * `Viewer`: View-only
* **Predefined Roles**: Granular, service-specific permissions
* **Custom Roles**: Admin-defined roles tailored to specific needs

#### Permissions

* Actions allowed on resources (e.g., `compute.instances.start`)

#### Policy Binding

* Combines **member** (identity) and **role** on a **resource**

### üõ† IAM Levels

* **Project-level IAM**: Grants access to all project resources
* **Service-level IAM**: Access to specific services
* **Resource-level IAM**: Fine-grained control (e.g., specific Cloud Storage bucket)

### ‚úÖ Best Practices

* Apply **Least Privilege**
* Prefer **Predefined Roles**
* Use **Service Accounts** for automation
* Use **Custom Roles** when needed
* Review policies regularly

### üìö Use Cases

* Granting access based on job roles
* Secure service-to-service communication
* Granting **temporary access**
* Audit with **Cloud Audit Logs**

---

## üîí IAP (Identity-Aware Proxy)

IAP controls access to applications and VMs based on the **identity of the user**, not the network or IP.

### üîë Key Features

* **Identity-based Access Control**: Users must authenticate with Google
* **IAM Integration**: Use Google IAM roles to define access
* **Secures Private Resources**: No need to expose apps to the public internet
* **Context-Aware Access**: Restrict by device, IP, location, etc.
* **Reverse Proxy**: Intercepts requests before they hit your app
* **No VPN Needed**: Eliminates the need for traditional VPNs
* **Audit Logs**: View who accessed what and when

### üß© Example Use Case

A private internal dashboard on GCP is protected with IAP. Only users in the `engineering@company.com` Google Group can access it. Even though the app runs on a private subnet, IAP enables secure user-level access.

---

## üöÄ Cloud Run

Cloud Run is a **fully managed**, **serverless** compute platform for running **containerized applications** that scale automatically.

### üåü Highlights

* **Serverless**: No infrastructure management
* **Runs Containers**: Any language or framework via Docker
* **Auto-Scales**: Down to zero when idle
* **Stateless**: Each request is isolated
* **Pay-Per-Use**: Only pay during active requests
* **Language-Agnostic**: Use anything that runs in a container
* **HTTP-Based**: Ideal for APIs, web services
* **Fast Deployment**: Push to registry, deploy instantly
* **Custom Domains + HTTPS**: Built-in SSL support

### üß™ Example Use Case

You build an image-resizing service using Python. You package it into a Docker container, deploy to Cloud Run, and it automatically scales based on traffic. You only pay when requests are being served.

# Google Cloud Platform (GCP) - Key Concepts Summary

This document provides a summarized overview of the GCP services and concepts discussed today, which include Cloud Run, App Engine, Pub/Sub, and GCP storage options.

---

## Cloud Run

**Summary:**
Cloud Run is a fully managed, serverless platform for running containerized applications. It auto-scales based on HTTP traffic and charges only when the application is running. It is ideal for deploying microservices, APIs, and stateless applications with variable or unpredictable workloads.

**Key Features:**

* Serverless, no infrastructure management
* Deploy using Docker containers
* Supports any language, runtime, or library
* Automatic scaling (zero to N)
* Integrated with IAM, Cloud Logging, and Monitoring

---

## App Engine

**Summary:**
Google App Engine (GAE) is a fully managed Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that abstracts infrastructure concerns, allowing developers to focus solely on writing code. It supports automatic scaling and multiple programming languages.

**Key Features:**

* Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)
* Fully managed environment
* Automatic scaling
* Supports Java, Python, Go, PHP, Node.js, Ruby
* Two environments:

  * **Standard**: Predefined runtime, cost-efficient, fast scaling
  * **Flexible**: Custom Docker containers, more control
* Integrated traffic splitting and versioning
* IAM integration and automatic security patches
* Logging and monitoring with Cloud tools

**Example Use Case:**
Deploying a Flask-based blog application that scales with demand without manual infrastructure management.

## Cloud Pub/Sub

**Summary:**
Google Cloud Pub/Sub is a fully managed messaging service used for building event-driven systems and decoupling microservices.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Publisher**: Sends messages to a topic
* **Topic**: A conduit for messages
* **Subscriber**: Consumes messages via subscriptions
* **Subscription**:

  * **Push**: Pub/Sub pushes messages to an HTTP endpoint
  * **Pull**: Subscribers fetch messages
* **Message Retention**: Up to 7 days
* **Delivery Guarantee**: At-least-once delivery

**Features:**

* Asynchronous messaging
* Decoupled architecture
* Real-time data/event processing
* Global scalability and reliability

**Terraform Example:**

```hcl
resource "google_pubsub_topic" "my_topic" {
  name = "my-topic"
}

resource "google_pubsub_subscription" "my_subscription" {
  name  = "my-subscription"
  topic = google_pubsub_topic.my_topic.id
  ack_deadline_seconds = 20
}
```
